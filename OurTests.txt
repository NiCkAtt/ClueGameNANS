We made sure in our legend to test several room, but also wanted to make sure that we also testing non-card rooms such
as walkway and closet. We also made sure to test first and last item in the legend.

As for the spaces, we tried to sample from across the map with a variety of different rooms rather than just one general
area. We had plenty of doors to choose from, so we just made sure to select the ones that were up, down, left, and right.

Also tested walkways from different parts of the board.
